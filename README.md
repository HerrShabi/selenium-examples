# selenium-examples

Hey all, I added some examples how should a base_page and a login_page (or any other) 

# Tech stack:
Capybara which is a ruby gem on top of selenium driver. it's similar, but is more "Ruby" style to write code.
Ruby 2.3

# Example files:
1. source/base_page_example.rb
2. source/login_page_example.rb

Feel free to go to the 'source' folder and try to see if it makes sense to you, this is of course just a code example and there are no gem file here or any packages / deployment, but just a representation of how page-objects design pattern should look like.
