# selenium-examples

Hey all, I added some examples how should a base_page should look like, this base_page is part of the pages module which all pages should be.
It also uses Capybara which is a ruby gem on top of selenium driver... it's similar, but is more "Ruby" style to write code.

I hope it helps, Have fun.

Raz.
